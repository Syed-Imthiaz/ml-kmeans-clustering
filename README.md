## 📊 K-Means Clustering on Synthetic Data

This project demonstrates the K-Means Clustering algorithm using Scikit-learn. It generates synthetic data with multiple clusters and applies K-Means to identify and visualize them.

---

## 🔍 About the Data
The dataset is generated using make_blobs() and contains 300 samples grouped into 4 clusters with 2 features each. This synthetic data is ideal for visualizing unsupervised learning.

## 🧠 ML Algorithm: K-Means

This project:
Creates clustered data with make_blobs

Applies K-Means clustering with:

    k-means++ initialization

    4 clusters

    300 iterations max

Visualizes the clustered data and centroids using Matplotlib
