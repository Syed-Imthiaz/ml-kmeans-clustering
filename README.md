## 📊 K-Means Clustering on Synthetic Data

This project demonstrates the K-Means Clustering algorithm using Scikit-learn. It generates synthetic data with multiple clusters and applies K-Means to identify and visualize them.

---

## 🔍 About the Dataset

The dataset is generated using make_blobs() and contains 300 samples grouped into 4 clusters with 2 features each. This synthetic data is ideal for visualizing unsupervised learning.
